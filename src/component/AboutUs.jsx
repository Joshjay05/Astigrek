        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          The public institution "Turn to the children" is a non-governmental
          organization founded in 1996 in Vilnius. On average, about 60 children
          between the ages of 3 and 19 live at the same time in the community
          care home "Turn to the children". Currently, children live in families
          of 5-8 children per family. In total, we have already established 10
          families in the city of Vilnius. We provide not only social care
          services for children who have lost parental care in Vilnius city and
          Vilnius district, but also day employment services for children at
          risk and their families.

          The main goal of our organization is to provide shelter to children
          who have lost parental care, to take care of the adaptation of these
          children in society, and if possible, to return them to their
          biological family. We aim to raise responsible, self-confident young
          people who will become full members of society. We help them at the
          beginning of independent life and encourage them to get involved in
          social activities.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-6">
          The main mission of "Turn to the children" is to provide social care
          services and psychosocial assistance to children who have lost
          parental care, and to provide day employment services to children
          growing up in social risk families, to spread the experience gained in
          the field of children's social care, and to raise the qualifications
          of social workers.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-6">
          The vision of "Turn to the children" is to create a multifunctional
          modern center, to provide high-quality social care services for
          children and young people, to develop positive parenting skills in the
          family, and to provide methodological assistance to social service
          institutions.

          In 2011, "Turn to the children" founded a methodical center, where it
          organizes trainings, seminars, and conferences for children living in
          child care institutions and for workers working with children who have
          lost parental care, as well as prepares methodical publications for
          children and workers about preparing children in care for independent
          life, positive development of parenting skills, and preparing for a
          family.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mt-6">
          One of the main goals of "Turn to the children" is to help children
          prepare for a full independent life in society and to support them
          after leaving. For this purpose, we have established a foster care
          family where adult children live. The youth home becomes the first
          safe environment that promotes independence, where the young person
          has the opportunity to safely take the first steps towards adult life.
          We help our young people choose the right educational institution,
          find their first job, rent a separate apartment, and develop their
          social and work skills.
